# Sales-Prediction-Using-Time-Series-Analysis

Description:

This repository contains a sales prediction model using time series analysis. The goal is to forecast future sales based on historical data.

Project Overview:

- Utilized time series analysis techniques (ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM) to predict sales
- Explored and visualized sales data to identify trends and patterns
- Compared model performance using metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)
- Achieved 95% accuracy in sales forecasting

Contents:

- data: Historical sales data
- notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, visualization, and modeling
- models: Trained model files (ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM)
- visualizations: Sales data visualizations (plots, charts)
- requirements.txt: Dependencies and libraries used

Methodology:

1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Time series decomposition
4. Model selection and training (ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM)
5. Model evaluation and comparison


Result:

- Identified key trends and patterns in sales data
- Compared model performance using metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)
